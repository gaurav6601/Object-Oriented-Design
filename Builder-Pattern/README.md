<h3>Builder Pattern</h3>
As the name implies builder pattern is used to build objects<br>
Sometimes we create objects which are complex and require elaborate construction process<br>
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.<br>
 The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code<br>
It hides the process of building a complex object and separates the representation of object and its construction<br>
The separation allows us to construct different representation using the same construction process<br>
1 solution for this problem is a large constructor which will handle all different cases <br>
like i want to build a kia car it has two models<br>
lets assume kia carnival has <br>
